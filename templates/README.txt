Implementation Notes:

- None of the directory structure is finalized. We are using the Clask web framework so it mandates a certain structure.

- Views common to both admin and regular user are within the Deliverable 4 folder. Views used only for admins are in the "admin pages" folder. Views used only for regular users are in the "user pages" folder. External CSS files are in the "styles" folder. All images for this deliverable are in the "images" folder

- All information in views are hard-coded so there will be a lack of consistancy on certain pages since the database has not been setup

- Niche views such as popupus and small windows have not been implemented because they can be achieved with scripting (Javascript/JQuery). Only minimal amounts of scripting have been used for this Deliverable for functional purposes.

- We utilized MD Bootstrap (Material Design Skinned Bootstrap Framework)

- HTML Page views have not been W3 Validated yet

- We chose the name Nile because it was another large river (like Amazon). The Nile logo was made by one of our group members!
